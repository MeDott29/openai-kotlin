# SwipeAI: Agentic Social Network

SwipeAI is a mobile application that combines a swipe-based user interface with an agentic graph reasoning system. Users can swipe through content cards (left to reject, right to like), and the system learns from these interactions to generate more personalized content.

## Key Features

- **Swipe-Based Interface**: Users can swipe left to reject or right to like content cards.
- **GPT-4o Content Generation**: Content is dynamically generated by GPT-4o based on user preferences.
- **Agentic Social Network**: A simulated network of AI agents that act as users, creating and interacting with content.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: The system learns from user interactions to generate more relevant content.
- **Graph-Based Reasoning**: Uses graph theory to model relationships between users, content, and interests.

## Technical Architecture

### Components

1. **UI Layer (MainActivity.kt)**
   - Implements the swipe card interface
   - Manages user interactions
   - Displays content cards

2. **Agentic Social Network (AgenticSocialNetwork.kt)**
   - Manages the simulated social network of AI agents
   - Handles content generation using GPT-4o
   - Tracks user preferences and interactions
   - Uses graph theory to model relationships

3. **Data Models**
   - `ContentCard`: Represents content displayed to users
   - `User`: Represents real users and AI agents
   - `Content`: Internal representation of content with metadata
   - `Interaction`: Records user interactions with content

### How It Works

1. **Initialization**:
   - The system creates a real user and multiple simulated AI agents
   - Each agent has unique interests and personality traits
   - Initial content is generated based on agent interests

2. **Content Generation**:
   - GPT-4o generates content based on agent interests
   - Content includes title, body text, and relevant tags

3. **User Interaction**:
   - Users swipe left (reject) or right (like) on content cards
   - Interactions are recorded and used to update user preferences
   - The system learns which topics and content styles the user prefers

4. **Personalization**:
   - As users interact with content, the system builds a preference profile
   - New content is generated that aligns with user preferences
   - The social graph evolves based on interactions

5. **Social Network Simulation**:
   - AI agents interact with content (like/dislike)
   - Agents form connections based on shared interests
   - The network evolves organically through interactions

## Implementation Details

- Built with Jetpack Compose for modern UI
- Uses OpenAI's GPT-4o for content generation
- Implements JGraphT for graph operations
- Coroutines for asynchronous operations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio Arctic Fox or later
- JDK 11 or higher
- OpenAI API key

### Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Set your OpenAI API key in the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`
3. Open the project in Android Studio
4. Build and run the application

### Known Issues

The project may encounter build issues related to Java version compatibility. If you encounter these issues:

1. Make sure you have JDK 11 or higher installed
2. Update the `gradle.properties` file to point to your JDK installation:
   ```
   org.gradle.java.home=/path/to/your/jdk
   ```
3. Update the Java compatibility in `app/build.gradle.kts`:
   ```kotlin
   compileOptions {
       sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_11
       targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_11
   }
   kotlinOptions {
       jvmTarget = "11"
   }
   ```

### Console Demo

If you prefer to see the core functionality without building the Android app, you can run the console demo:

1. Navigate to the `console-app` directory
2. Set your OpenAI API key in the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`
3. Run the application with Gradle:
   ```
   ./gradlew run
   ```

The console demo will:
- Initialize a social network with simulated agents
- Generate initial content
- Simulate user interactions
- Generate personalized content based on those interactions

## Future Enhancements

- Persistent storage for user preferences and interactions
- More sophisticated graph algorithms for content recommendation
- Enhanced visualization of the social network
- User profiles and customization options
- Real-time interaction between users

## Requirements

- Kotlin 1.9.0 or higher
- JDK 11 or higher
- OpenAI API key

## Dependencies

- OpenAI Kotlin Client (com.aallam.openai:openai-client)
- Ktor Client OkHttp (io.ktor:ktor-client-okhttp)
- Kotlinx Coroutines (org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core)
- Kotlinx Serialization (org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-serialization-json)
- JGraphT (org.jgrapht:jgrapht-core)
- SLF4J Simple (org.slf4j:slf4j-simple)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:
   ```
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```
3. Build the project:
   ```
   ./gradlew build
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```
   ./gradlew run
   ```

## Output

The system generates several outputs:

1. **Console Output**: Detailed information about the graph construction process, including new concepts, relationships, and graph metrics.
2. **JSON Files**: The knowledge graph is saved as JSON files in the `graph_data` directory.
3. **Visualizations**: Interactive HTML visualizations of the knowledge graph are saved in the `graph_visualizations` directory.

## Customization

You can customize the system by modifying:

- The initial prompt in `GraphReasoner.kt`
- The number of iterations (`maxIterations` in `GraphReasoner.kt`)
- The model used (`modelId` in `GraphReasoner.kt`)

## Paper Implementation

This implementation demonstrates the key concepts from the paper:

1. **Agentic Graph Expansion**: The system actively generates new concepts and relationships based on the current state of the graph.
2. **Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks**: The graph organizes itself into a coherent structure through the iterative process.
3. **Emergent Patterns**: The system identifies hub concepts and bridge nodes through centrality analysis.
4. **Open-Ended Knowledge Construction**: The graph continues to expand without saturating, generating new insights with each iteration.
